# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
My task create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

## What was done
* The current day is displayed at the top
* time block is color-coded to indicate wether it is in the past, present, or future
* save button has icon and now the text for that event is saved in local storage.
